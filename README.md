# Linear-Regression-single-variable
# Canada Per Capita Income Prediction
Overview
This project builds a Linear Regression model to predict Canada's per capita income for the year 2020 using historical data. The dataset is sourced from canada_per_capita_income.csv.

Dataset
The dataset contains year-wise per capita income of Canadian citizens.

It is used to train a Simple Linear Regression model to make future predictions.

Steps Followed
Load the Dataset: Read canada_per_capita_income.csv using pandas.

Data Exploration: Check for missing values, visualize trends using scatter plots.

Model Training: Use LinearRegression() from sklearn to train the model.

Fit the model using year as an independent variable and per capita income as the dependent variable.

Prediction: Use the trained model to predict per capita income for 2020.

Visualization: Plot the regression line to understand the trend.

Results
The predicted per capita income for 2020 is 41288.69409442 USD.

Technologies Used
Python
Pandas
Matplotlib
Scikit-Learn
